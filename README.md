# RoseWindows_in_Assisi_with_MATLAB
Script and function MATLAB to create rose windows and to reproduce the rose windows of the churches in Assisi.

All scripts and functions are thoroughly commented to clarify their specific purpose and logic. The scripts are executable and generate the rose window figures or the individual geometric elements used in their construction. Specifically, the scripts responsible for generating the rose windows of the various churches in Assisi are named after the respective basilicas. A comprehensive paper detailing the historical origins and the mathematical rationale behind these scripts is currently in preparation.
